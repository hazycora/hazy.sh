Instead, you'll only see a \"summary card\" Twitter generates when a post is made. The domain name of the URL is displayed in these cards, so at face value they don't make phishing easier.\n\n![A Tweet displaying a summary card linking to discord.com](/blog/twitter-summary-card-phishing/card-example-domain-highlighted.png)\n\n## their implementation is Not Perfect\n\nIf a link redirects to another page, Twitter follows that redirect and displays the domain name of the destination instead of the original URL. This is fine, it means the cards will reflect the same page users will see.\nBut the user isn't sent directly to the destination- When someone clicks one of these cards, they go to the original URL. For typical redirect links, that's okay, because the redirect Twitter experiences will we the same as the user's redirect. But what if a malicious site serves a different redirect to users than to Twitter?\n\nWhen Twitter fetches the page content in order to generate these cards, they set the HTTP \"User-Agent\" header to begin with \"Twitterbot/\", so it can be detected on our website that the request was for Twitter. Setting custom User-Agents for things like this is normal, it means sites can customise the text of embeds for specific sites if necessary or block Twitter from making these requests if desired, but for malicious sites it also allows us to exploit this issue reliably.\n\nHere's an example of an ExpressJS route that detects Twitter and redirects to discord.com, while redirecting to example.com for everyone else:\n\n```js\napp.get('/', (req, res, next) => {\n\tconst detectedTwitter = req.headers['user-agent']\n\t\t.toLowerCase()\n\t\t.startsWith('Twitterbot/')\n\n\tif (detectedTwitter) {\n\t\t// redirect to the page to be displayed on Twitter\n\t\tres.redirect('https://discord.com')\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// handle request for other users\n\t// malicious sites could serve a phishing site right here\n\tres.redirect('https://example.com')\n})\n```\n\n![An animated GIF showing a Tweet that looks to contain a link to Discord, but sends users to example.com instead](/blog/twitter-summary-card-phishing/demo.gif)\n\n## this issue is old\n\nTwitter has had this issue for years, and I'm by no means the first to notice it.
