I've uploaded\nthis file as [a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/hazycora/f7fde1be74022d196945577a1817d153).\n\nThe list is _almost_ entirely what you'd expect. Just a bunch of swears and slurs, exactly what I would want to be blocked if I\nhad a chat filter option turned on.

Do not interpret any of this as malice or bias.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nHere are just a handful of words which are censored, and probably shouldn't be.

This causes them to be completely ignored when filtering words.\n\n![The word bastard shown in the chat.](/blog/webfishings-silly-filter/bastard.png)\n\n## How'd that happen?\n\nSo, as I said in the disclaimer, I believe this list was certainly just copy-pasted from somewhere online. But where? I don't\nactually know where _exactly_ they found it, but I've got a pretty big lead. Searching Google for profanity lists, I stumbled upon\n[`bad-words.txt`](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt), which includes many of these same words. It also includes many more words, though, so Webfishing's developer either tried to\nmanually sort through the list and didn't catch enough things, or they found a different version of this list.\n\nThe feature was added in the very last update, [Patch 1.09](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444), and I don't doubt it'll get fixed soon enough :)\n","\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Update:\u003C/strong> The developer, lamedev, \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://lethallava.land/notes/a0hatpsc0g\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>knows of this\u003C/a>!
