<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" rel="nofollow"><code>bad-words.txt</code></a>, which includes many of these same words. It also includes many more words, though, so Webfishing’s developer either tried to
manually sort through the list and didn’t catch enough things, or they found a different version of this list.`,W,H,V='The feature was added in the very last update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444" rel="nofollow">Patch 1.09</a>, and I don’t doubt it’ll get fixed soon enough :)';return{c(){s=o("p"),s.innerHTML=p,f=h(),m=o("hr"),a=h(),n=o("p"),n.innerHTML=M,C=h(),v=o("p"),v.innerHTML=B,I=h(),c=o("div"),c.innerHTML=D,k=h(),y=o("p"),y.textContent=G,P=h(),b=o("ul"),b.innerHTML=E,$=h(),_=o("p"),_.innerHTML=R,q=h(),g=o("p"),g.textContent=U,j=h(),x=o("p"),x.innerHTML=J,S=h(),w=o("h2"),w.innerHTML=N,z=h(),T=o("p"),T.innerHTML=O,W=h(),H=o("p"),H.innerHTML=V,this.h()},l(e){s=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(s)!=="svelte-1ndy666"&&(s.innerHTML=p),f=d(e),m=r(e,"HR",{}),a=d(e),n=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(n)!=="svelte-qylxbx"&&(n.innerHTML=M),C=d(e),v=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(v)!=="svelte-18x58up"&&(v.innerHTML=B),I=d(e),c=r(e,"DIV",{style:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(c)!=="svelte-ifx3tg"&&(c.innerHTML=D),k=d(e),y=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(y)!=="svelte-1l4bll"&&(y.textContent=G),P=d(e),b=r(e,"UL",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(b)!=="svelte-u8q6kk"&&(b.innerHTML=E),$=d(e),_=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(_)!=="svelte-1w625mw"&&(_.innerHTML=R),q=d(e),g=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(g)!=="svelte-bot6pq"&&(g.textContent=U),j=d(e),x=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(x)!=="svelte-1ut76pl"&&(x.innerHTML=J),S=d(e),w=r(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(w)!=="svelte-1v3esx3"&&(w.innerHTML=N),z=d(e),T=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(T)!=="svelte-p5z4ef"&&(T.innerHTML=O),W=d(e),H=r(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(H)!=="svelte-17yj0c3"&&(H.innerHTML=V),this.h()},h(){oe(c,"font-size","1.25rem"),re(w,"id","howd-that-happen")},m(e,t){l(e,s,t),l(e,f,t),l(e,m,t),l(e,a,t),l(e,n,t),l(e,C,t),l(e,v,t),l(e,I,t),l(e,c,t),l(e,k,t),l(e,y,t),l(e,P,t),l(e,b,t),l(e,$,t),l(e,_,t),l(e,q,t),l(e,g,t),l(e,j,t),l(e,x,t),l(e,S,t),l(e,w,t),l(e,z,t),l(e,T,t),l(e,W,t),l(e,H,t)},p:X,d(e){e&&(i(s),i(f),i(m),i(a),i(n),i(C),i(v),i(I),i(c),i(k),i(y),i(P),i(b),i($),i(_),i(q),i(g),i(j),i(x),i(S),i(w),i(z),i(T),i(W),i(H))}}}function fe(L){let s,p;const f=[L[0],K];let m={$$slots:{default:[de]},$$scope:{ctx:L}};for(let a=0;a<f.length;a+=1)m=A(m,f[a]);return s=new ue({props:m}),{c(){te(s.$$.fragment)},l(a){le(s.$$.fragment,a)},m(a,n){ie(s,a,n),p=!0},p(a,[n]){const M=n&1?he(f,[n&1&&F(a[0]),n&0&&F(K)]):{};n&2&&(M.$$scope={dirty:n,ctx:a}),s.$set(M)},i(a){p||(se(s.$$.fragment,a),p=!0)},o(a){ae(s.$$.fragment,a),p=!1},d(a){ne(s,a)}}}const K={title:"Webfishing's bizarre profanity filter",description:"Canadians are being CENSORED by the adorable furry fishing game",date:"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"};function pe(L,s,p){return L.$$set=f=>{p(0,s=A(A({},s),Z(f)))},s=Z(s),[s]}class ye extends Y{constructor(s){super(),ee(this,s,pe,fe,Q,{})}}export{ye as component};
