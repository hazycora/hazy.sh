<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" rel="nofollow"><code>bad-words.txt</code></a>, which includes many of these same words. It also includes many more words, though, so Webfishing’s developers either tried to
manually sort through the list and didn’t catch enough things, or they found a different version of this list.`,j,T,J='The feature was added in the very last update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444" rel="nofollow">Patch 1.09</a>, and I don’t doubt it’ll get fixed soon enough :)';return{c(){t=h("p"),t.innerHTML=c,f=p(),o=h("p"),o.innerHTML=n,a=p(),r=h("div"),r.innerHTML=S,L=p(),y=h("p"),y.textContent=z,M=p(),b=h("ul"),b.innerHTML=W,C=p(),v=h("p"),v.innerHTML=B,I=p(),_=h("p"),_.textContent=D,k=p(),g=h("p"),g.innerHTML=G,P=p(),w=h("h2"),w.innerHTML=A,$=p(),x=h("p"),x.innerHTML=E,j=p(),T=h("p"),T.innerHTML=J,this.h()},l(e){t=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(t)!=="svelte-qylxbx"&&(t.innerHTML=c),f=m(e),o=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(o)!=="svelte-18x58up"&&(o.innerHTML=n),a=m(e),r=u(e,"DIV",{style:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(r)!=="svelte-1y8nwzb"&&(r.innerHTML=S),L=m(e),y=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(y)!=="svelte-1l4bll"&&(y.textContent=z),M=m(e),b=u(e,"UL",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(b)!=="svelte-ngvuxf"&&(b.innerHTML=W),C=m(e),v=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(v)!=="svelte-1w625mw"&&(v.innerHTML=B),I=m(e),_=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(_)!=="svelte-bot6pq"&&(_.textContent=D),k=m(e),g=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(g)!=="svelte-1ut76pl"&&(g.innerHTML=G),P=m(e),w=u(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(w)!=="svelte-1v3esx3"&&(w.innerHTML=A),$=m(e),x=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(x)!=="svelte-111apxs"&&(x.innerHTML=E),j=m(e),T=u(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(T)!=="svelte-17yj0c3"&&(T.innerHTML=J),this.h()},h(){se(r,"font-size","1.25rem"),ie(w,"id","howd-that-happen")},m(e,s){i(e,t,s),i(e,f,s),i(e,o,s),i(e,a,s),i(e,r,s),i(e,L,s),i(e,y,s),i(e,M,s),i(e,b,s),i(e,C,s),i(e,v,s),i(e,I,s),i(e,_,s),i(e,k,s),i(e,g,s),i(e,P,s),i(e,w,s),i(e,$,s),i(e,x,s),i(e,j,s),i(e,T,s)},p:V,d(e){e&&(l(t),l(f),l(o),l(a),l(r),l(L),l(y),l(M),l(b),l(C),l(v),l(I),l(_),l(k),l(g),l(P),l(w),l($),l(x),l(j),l(T))}}}function oe(H){let t,c;const f=[H[0],R];let o={$$slots:{default:[ae]},$$scope:{ctx:H}};for(let n=0;n<f.length;n+=1)o=q(o,f[n]);return t=new ne({props:o}),{c(){K(t.$$.fragment)},l(n){Q(t.$$.fragment,n)},m(n,a){X(t,n,a),c=!0},p(n,[a]){const r=a&1?le(f,[a&1&&O(n[0]),a&0&&O(R)]):{};a&2&&(r.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:n}),t.$set(r)},i(n){c||(Y(t.$$.fragment,n),c=!0)},o(n){ee(t.$$.fragment,n),c=!1},d(n){te(t,n)}}}const R={title:"Webfishing's bizarre profanity filter",description:"Canadians are being CENSORED by the adorable furry fishing game",date:"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z"};function re(H,t,c){return H.$$set=f=>{c(0,t=q(q({},t),N(f)))},t=N(t),[t]}class pe extends Z{constructor(t){super(),F(this,t,re,oe,U,{})}}export{pe as component};
